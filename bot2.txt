//order is as follows: index type access_level count keyword(s) [keycode] <message|keyword(s)>
// a same index indicates a type 4 or 5
//type 1 means normal command, no key presses
//type 2 means key press, which has an extra parameter, but can also include a message
//type 3 means Overload (which happens when the same parameters are given as the overload needs, or the access_level matches in a way that doesn't match earlier ones, the keyword will be exactly the same,leaving the message blank will cause nothing to appear when no pars are given)
//type 4 means Addition (which happens if the command with the index is called, this message is also send)
//type 5 means Key-Addition (which happens if the command with the index is called, this key is pressed, and the message is also send)
//type 6 is an alias for the command, in fact, all aliases are stored on this line.
//count is based on keyword
1 1 0 2872 !what This is a random number generator playing Pok√©mon Fire Red and Leaf Green with random input. That means it is being played by a computer, not a human. Like a robot playing Gameboy, except without the fancy technology. Sometimes we assist it if it gets really stuck. Finally, as I said 200@cnt@ times before, you can't use chat inputs, this is not Twitch Plays!
