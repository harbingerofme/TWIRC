How the bot will/should work with the chat

(all commands are case-insensitive, mandatory parameters are enclosed in <>, optional parameters in []. Any enclosing should be omitted when entering a command)

With a new fresh start, there'd be 3 commands available to the bot.
	-!comhelp <command> sends a description of a hardcoded command to the chat.
	-!addcom <keyword(s)> (to take a keyword literally, enclose the command in <>) <message/functions> (<> should always be omitted here) //adds a new command with specified message, if the message is empty, the bot will simply not do anything upon someone saying this command. (it will add 1 to the count though)
	-!addkey <keyword(s)> <key_code>(not enclosed) <message/functions> //sets up a command to press a certain key, access level restricted to 3
	
Using any of the above commands will add the command to a file ( see the other .txt for an example, and explanation)
Upon having any commands, the following commands will be useable (since, well, they need a target. (you could potentially target the default commands with these, but that aside))
	-!editcom <keyword(s)> (matches aliases too) <message> //you can only edit the messages of a commands this way.
	-!addalias <keyword(s)> <newKeyword> (put a space between keywords to add multiple at once) (these keywords can not be a command already, nor can they be in an alias of a command)//
	-!editkey <keyword(s)> <new_key> [message] (if you want to put an empty message, use !editcom)
	-!addMoreCom <keyword(s)> <message> (this also works for key-commands, but only sends a message) //creates an additon, see the example file for more explanation
	-!addMoreKey <keyword(s)> <key_code> <message> //adds a key - Addition
	-!addOverload <keyword(s)> message //(for the time being, I see no reason to add this functionality to keys) see the example file
	-!delCom <keyword(s)> (add more, separated by spaces) //deletes a commands, if this matches an alias, it will tell the user the command still persists, and only remove the alias, if it matches a command, all lines referencing to it will be removed.
	-!delAddition <keyword(s)> //deletes the last addition entered for a command
	-!describeCom <keyword(s)> //sends a message with what a command does, it's aliases and additions
	
Special functions that can be added to a command
		@count@ - times the command (or an alias/overload) has been called
		@par#@ - # denotes which parameter to look for, parameters are separated by spaces.
		@par#-@ - all parameters until the end
		@par#-#@ - numbered parameter until the other specified one.
		@rand#@ - a random number ranging from 0 to the number (can be negative)
		@rand#-#@ - a random number between the two specified ones. (if you are looking for a negative OR positive number, start with the one below zero, and make the other number above zero. If you are looking for a negative number in general, just add a - (minus) in front of the commands
		@randUser@ - will produce a random user in the chat
		@user@ - the person who called the command
		{<message>} {<message>} {etc.} - will produce any of these messages (based on the modulo of the count, so it should cycle through the messages)
